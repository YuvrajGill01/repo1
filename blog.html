                        <h2>Do you have a handful of blogs that you follow purely for fun?</h2>
                        <p>Over the past few years, I’ve moved away from following primarily recipe blogs to spending my time enjoying other types of lifestyle blogs, and it has been awesome. I have blog categories on Feedly for photographers I admire, cool people working for social justice, interesting perspectives on faith, DIY stuff I actually want to try, you name it! Mostly they’re just blogs that have nothing to do with recipes, and I find that I look forward to reading them more than ever. But that said, the blogs in my reader that get the most clicks by a landslide are in my favorite category that I have oh-so-creatively named — get ready for it — “fun”.</p>

                            Do you use Feedly and/or Pocket? I love both apps to read and then save from my favorite blogs!.</p>
